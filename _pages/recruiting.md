The Future Computing Lab (FCL) is looking for **multiple** highly qualified Ph.D. students, staring in Fall 2026. Postdoc and intern positions may be available to outstanding candidates.

We are broadly interested in building **efficient computing systems for important workloads**, and we work **across the stack** (e.g., topics spanning ML, databases, systems, and architecture). Some topics we are exploring include:

- **Systems for ML**
  - Software systems for ML
  - Hardware systems for ML
  - Efficient ML algorithms
- **Vector search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Retrieval and RAG algorithms
  - Systems for retrieval and RAG
- **Systems for emerging workloads** (topics evolve over time)
